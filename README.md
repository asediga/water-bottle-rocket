## Rocket Altitude Determining Factors
* Weight of the Rocket
* Nose Design
* Thrust from Pressurized water + Air, 
   * Volume of water - 30% = ⅓ or 2000ml
   * Air pressure - 60 psi
* Fin Factors  
   * Location of fins - evenly spaced
   * Shape
   * Number of fins - 4
   * Angle of fin attachment - 2 degrees
* Stability
   * Center of Gravity(CG) ahead of center of Pressure
 
## Fin Design
* Need firm, thin and light weight plastic material
* Create 4 fins using the dimensions in this diagram
* Attach 4 fins to the bottom of the 2 liter pepsi bottle

## Parachute Design
* Size of parachute
* Shape
  * Mushroom
  * Reefing
* String position  on the parachute
* Attachment of ping pong ball
* Use the right size parachute for your rocket
* Fold the parachute like an accordion and then wrap extra string around it to keep it folded
* Use light, thin ply plastic (e.g., dry cleaning bag)
* Vent holes will reduce air spillage
* Parachute Strings
  * The parachute should have 8 to 10 strings
  * Light string work best – String length should be greater than diameter of the parachute
  * Use baby powder to combat cling
* Investigate options for deploying the parachute from the rocket
* Research, design, test, improve, repeat!!

## Factors to help ensure stability 
* The center of gravity should be ahead of the center of pressure 
* Proper fin placement
* Fins are used on smaller rockets to provide this stability and control direction.

## Center of Gravity
* Center of Gravity should be above the Center of Pressure 
  * **Center of Gravity (CG)** - The center of gravity is weight driven. It is the point where half the weight is on one end of the rocket and half the weight is on the other end.
  * **Center of Pressure (CP)** – The center of pressure is surface area driven. It is the point where half the surface area of rocket is one side and half is on the other. During flight, the pressure of air rushing past the rocket will balance half on one side and half on the other.

## Finding Your Center
* Finding the Center of Gravity 
  – Option 1 – Do complex mathematical calculations 
  – Option 2 - Balance the entire rocket using a string to find the point at which the rocket is balanced 
* Finding the Center of Pressure 
  – Option 1 – Do complex mathematical calculations 
  – Option 2 - Cut out the silhouette of the rocket from cardboard and balance it on a ruler

## Fin Placement
Fins must be attached with tape 5 cm or higher above the level of the bottle’s opening • Each fin should be same size and shape 
- There are several recommended fin shapes 
– use test flights to evaluate which one works best with your design 
- Fins should be evenly spaced around the pressure chamber. Measure circumference of the pressure chamber. Divide by the number of fins you are using. That is how far apart the fins should be.
